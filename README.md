The Magic Cube that never falls apart even if rotated at an insane speed.

This is a lightweight library that implements basic operations of the Magic Cube (Rubik's Cube). Now available in the following languages:
* JavaScript

Features
--------

* Simple Cube object creation
* Move the Cube with one method call. Single-layer turns (*F*, *B*, *U*, *D*, *L*, *R*, *M*, *E*, *S*, *MR*, *ML* etc. in Singmaster notation), multi-layer turns (*r* / *TR*, *l* / *TL* etc.) and whole-cube rotations (*x*, *y*, *z*) are supported.
* Check whether the Cube matches a given pattern. Useful in coding an algorithm to solve the Cube automatically.

For API reference please see README files in separate language directories.
